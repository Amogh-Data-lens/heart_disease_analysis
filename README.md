Explored the dataset's shape (number of rows and columns).
Obtained information about the dataset, including data types and memory requirements.

*Data Cleaning:
Checked for null values and removed duplicate data.

*Statistical Analysis:
Computed overall statistics about the dataset.
Drew a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between variables.

*Target Variable Analysis:
Investigated the prevalence of heart disease in the dataset.
Explored gender distribution and age demographics.
